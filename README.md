# Communicate with VMXProxyPy using Pythonista

Warning: designed mainly for iPad in landscape mode, results may vary.

## requirements
pythonista 3 (not tested with 2)
stash (optional, makes installation MUCH easier)

## installation

simply git clone using stash's git client, or download each script individually

## usage

VMixerMasterConsole.py is currently outdated, I should either fix it up or remove it.
All it does is mute/unmute inputs, and it's not yet updated with the fixes necessary to work with the proxy correctly.

run VMixerChannelView to manage output channels AUX1-8, MTX1-4 and Mains, setting mute, unmute and fader volume. Soon there will be the capability to set the volume for each input, for any given output.
